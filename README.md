# Mollie App
This is a comprehenisve dashboard for your Mollie statistics and CRUD management.

## Why?

I've noticed development on the Mollie dashboard has been quiet for a while. And I've always
lacked a few things in there, simple things as an subscription overview, or being able to edit the subscriptions/customers.
With the dashboard Mollie provides, the only thing you can 'really' do is view transactions and customers.

## How?

I've used Laravel, Fillament & Sushi to make this work.
I use Sushi to make the API calls work for Eloquent so Filament can work with that.

## Testing

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest
```
